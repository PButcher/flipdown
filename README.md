## Example

Example live at: https://pbutcher.uk/flipdown/

Remix FlipDown on CodePen: https://codepen.io/PButcher/pen/dzvMzZ

## Basic Usage

To get started, either clone this repo or install with `npm install flipdown` or `yarn add flipdown`.

For basic usage, FlipDown takes a unix timestamp (in seconds) as an argument.

```javascript
new FlipDown(1538137672).start();
```

Include the [CSS and JS](https://github.com/PButcher/flipdown/tree/master/dist) in `<head>` and include the following
line in your HTML.

```html

<div id="flipdown" class="flipdown"></div>
```

See a full example [here](https://github.com/PButcher/flipdown/tree/master/example).

## Extended Timer Usage

To display an extended timer, simply provide the extendedText option during instantiation:

```javascript
new FlipDown(1631000000, {
    extraTime: 5, // Set the extra time in seconds
}).start();
```
When extraTime is set, the timer will start extra countdown after the original one ends.

e.g: Bonus Time

## Multiple Instances

To use multiple instances of FlipDown on the same page, specify a DOM element ID as the second argument in FlipDown's
constructor:

```javascript
new FlipDown(1588017373, "registerBy").start();
new FlipDown(1593561600, "eventStart").start();
```

```html

<div id="registerBy" class="flipdown"></div>
<div id="eventStart" class="flipdown"></div>
```

## Themes

FlipDown comes with 2 themes as standard:

- dark [default]
- light

To change the theme, you can supply the `theme` property in the `opt` object in the constructor with the theme name as a
string:

```javascript
{
    theme: "light";
}
```

For example, to instantiate FlipDown using the light theme instead:

```javascript
new FlipDown(1538137672, {
    theme: "light",
}).start();
```

### Custom Themes

Custom themes can be added by adding a new stylesheet using the
FlipDown [theme template](https://github.com/PButcher/flipdown/blob/master/src/flipdown.css#L3-L34).

FlipDown themes must have the class name prefix of: `.flipdown__theme-` followed by the name of your theme. For example,
the standard theme class names are:

- `.flipdown__theme-dark`
- `.flipdown__theme-light`

You can then load your theme by specifying the `theme` property in the `opt` object of the constructor (
see [Themes](#Themes)).

## Headings

You can add your own rotor group headings by passing an array as part of the `opt` object. Bear in mind this won't
change the functionality of the rotors (eg: the 'days' rotor won't magically start counting months because you passed
it 'Months' as a heading).

Suggested use is for i18n. Usage as follows:

```javascript
new FlipDown(1538137672, {
    headings: ["Nap", "√ìra", "Perc", "M√°sodperc"],
}).start();
```

Note that headings will default to English if not provided: `["Days", "Hours", "Minutes", "Seconds"]`
